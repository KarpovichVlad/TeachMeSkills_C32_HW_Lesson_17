# The following tasks are implemented here:

Task 1
Create a generalized functional interface.
Write a class with a single method.
In this method, implement the logic:
- if the number 1 is entered into the console, then: use the interface with a string type and pass the logic of string reversal (output of the string in reverse order) to the interface method.
- if the number 2 is entered into the console, then: use the interface with an integer type and pass the logic of finding the factorial of the number to the interface method.

Task 2 (optional)
Get the day of the week by date
